# Background Generator
This is the first web page I developed. 
Actually, this is an execrise I did during the course "The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie.
On this page you can pick two colors to change the background gradient . At the bottom there is the CSS code of the gradient currently used in the DOM so any user can copy and paste it in it's own project to apply the shade of colors!
The lesson's focus was on how JavaScript can be used to change DOM in real time, developing a tool which users can interact with and use for their purposes. This lesson was very fun.
